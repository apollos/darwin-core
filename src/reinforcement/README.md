# Maintain a reinforcement network to control the genetic search path?:
## 1. Define the actions
## 2. Define the initial transform possibility among actions
## 3. Define the status which is the algorithm define
## 4. different types of layers:
### convolution (C), pooling (P), fully connected (FC), global average pooling (GAP), and softmax(SM)
## 5. Define the reward: according to loss to calculate it

# I do not combine genetics and deep-q in one model, how shall I design it??????
